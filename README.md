# My-Music-App-Tempo-
This mobile app was not only created in 2 weeks to challenge myself, but to also act as a way to show my skill in learning new technologies and adapting to the task given to me.

This was a good learning experience and reinforced the reason to me as to why we do computer science and technology as a hold, to solve real-world problems. The problem for me being I no longer had a music app. There were many issues, unsued features and ideas, here I will list them and a few other things to assist others who may come across my repo and use it for their gain as well:

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Since Google no longer provides a music player, I have to create one myself in 2 weeks( even if I could just download on )

It must be able to:

[v] Identify and access .mp3 ( or .wave ) files on the mobile device. And ignore other audio files.

[v] It must list the name of the song along with the artist if available and display the song's graphic and time stamp.

[v] Add the time of each song on the song select view. ( only got to a default placeholder )

[ ] Share song option.

[ ] Oh hold options for song select view that ask to : create a new playlist, add to an existing playlist, play next in the queue, find on, remove, etc.

[v] It must have a pause, skip back or forward, shuffle, repeat and or loop and raise volume feature. ( not fully implemented )

[v] Add a toolbar at the base of the app to switch between the song list view, playlist view, and current song playing.

[v] Must be able to use offline.

[v] Must be able to keep playing if the phone is asleep or if the app is not actively open with the same UI being able to be used either on the home screen or drop down. ( not fully implemented )

𝗔𝗱𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆:

[ ] Indication that shows which song is playing whether it be general library or playlist, and a way to interact with it like Spotify. Or YouTube playlist.

[ ] Create app Icon

[ ] Notification that pops up outside of the app whether on sleep or out, that allows you to skip, play / pause, etc.

[ ] It can have playlists, that can be named, ordered and removed.

[v] A search or filter item on the list view / song list view. ( not fully implemented )

[ ] And user interface that allows to change or add profiles if needed.

[ ] Must pause / lower on an incoming call or notification and resume or return to normal after.

[v] Detect headphone usage.

[ ] Have customizable themes like dark mode.

[ ] A button that says "Find on YouTube " that uses the YouTube API and searches for that song you click find on YouTube for and sends you there ( can also have the timestamps sync if possible but not needed )

[ ] Find on... button can also be an expanded feature that you click and then choose what platform you want to search for it, ie: Spotify, Soundcloud, YouTube, etc.

[ ] Custom Audio mixer / eq.

𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲𝘀: ( to name a few )

Seek bar doesn't dynamically track or doesn't always add up to the time duration.

Seek bar doesn't update after each new song to make it dynamic.

Make shuffle and loop/repeat toggle button and work as intended.

No search functionality.
