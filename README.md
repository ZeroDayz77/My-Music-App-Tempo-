# Tempo

This mobile app MVP was not only initially created in 2 weeks to challenge myself but to also act as a way to show my skill in learning new technologies and adapting to the task given to me.

This was a good learning experience and reinforced the reason to me as to why we do computer science and technology as a hold, to solve real-world problems. The problem for me was, I no longer had a music app. There were many issues, unused features and ideas. Here I will list them and a few other things to assist others who may come across my repo and use it for their gain as well:

## **Problem Statement**

> Since Google no longer provides a music player, I have to create one myself in 2 weeks( even if I could just download one )

## **Implementations**

### **Functional Tasks**

- [x] Identify and access .mp3 ( or .wave ) files on the mobile device. And ignore other audio files.

- [x] It must list the name of the song along with the artist if available and display the song's graphic and time stamp.

- [x] Add the time of each song to the song select view. ( only got to a default placeholder )

- [ ] Share song option.

- [ ] Oh hold options for song select view that ask to: create a new playlist, add to an existing playlist, play next in the queue, find on, remove, etc.

- [x] It must have a pause, skip back or forward, shuffle, repeat and or loop and raise volume feature. ( not fully implemented )

- [x] Add a toolbar at the base of the app to switch between the song list view, playlist view, and current song playing.

- [x] Must be able to use offline.

- [x] Must be able to keep playing if the phone is asleep or if the app is not actively open with the same UI being able to be used either on the home screen or dropdown. ( not fully implemented )

### **Non-functional Tasks**

- [ ] Indication that shows which song is playing whether it be a general library or playlist, and a way to interact with it like Spotify. Or a YouTube playlist.

- [x] App Icon

- [ ] Notification that pops up outside of the app whether on sleep or out, that allows you to skip, play/pause, etc. ( There is code for it but the current version doesn't fully implement it )

- [ ] It can have playlists, that can be named, ordered and removed.

- [x] A search or filter item on the list view/song list view. ( not fully implemented )

- [ ] And user interface that allows to change or add profiles if needed.

- [ ] Must pause / lower on an incoming call or notification and resume or return to normal after.

- [x] Detect headphone usage.

- [ ] Have customizable themes like dark mode.

- [ ] A button that says "Find on YouTube" that uses the YouTube API and searches for that song you click "find" on YouTube for and sends you there ( can also have the timestamps sync if possible but not needed )

- [ ] Find on... button can also be an expanded feature that you click and then choose what platform you want to search for it, ie: Spotify, Soundcloud, YouTube, etc.

- [ ] Custom Audio mixer/eq.

### **Main Issues** ( to name a few... )

> _Seek bar doesn't dynamically track or doesn't always add up to the time duration._

> _Seek bar doesn't update after each new song to make it dynamic._

> _Make shuffle and loop/repeat toggle buttons to work as intended._

> _No search functionality._
